#+STARTUP: align fold hidestars indent


* Fixed filesystem

Every node selects a list of publishers and the content from those publisers
is stored directly encripted in the disk of the server.

** Advantages
- Don't have to worry about distributing content. Content is stored directly
  in the nodes.
- Very easy to implement.
- Politically is better because the entire Bitcloud cannot be accused of
  storing illegal content, only some nodes.
  
** Disavantages
- Less optimized storage.
- Small nodes couldn't store the content of major publishers.
  
* Distributed filesystem
** Tahoe-Leafs like filesystem
