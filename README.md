# Bitcloud Objectives

For a technical overview, read
[overview.org](https://github.com/wetube/bitcloud/blob/master/overview.org).

In essence, what we want to do is construct a Peer to Peer cloud with economic
incentives, and a decentralized market for information in which everybody will have the
ability to upload, download, and publish content. All users will also have the 
ability to install a node.

Authors have an opportunity to offer their content without any restriction or
imposition, by selecting a publisher or becoming one themselves. Their
content will be immediately available the rest of the world via Bitcloud.

Bitcloud will be in charge of automatically distributing files around and along the
network, and checking all monetary transactions.

Publishers and authors will have the opportunity to have a voice without
having to compete against giant corporations. Our search engine will be globally
available and content cannot be deleted by a central authority. We don't
impose any kind of censorship nor do we impose any sort of central moderation 
system. We also offer optional, easy integration with Tor, protecting both the 
"origin" and the "destination" of the content.

At the same time, we offer the opportunity of optional moderation for any
publisher. Publishers will have the important role of manually filtering all of their
content and providing great quality. Anyone can become a publisher if that is what they desire.



# Help Work With Us

We want to make the process of creating Bitcloud *extremely* open,
allowing anyone who wants to participate to share their opinion and help with the project.


# Spread the Word

We are currently contacting developers and thinkers only as we don't want this project to 
become too mainstream until we have something to really work in and a good bunch of developers. 
This being said, we are looking to expand the development side of the project. So, please, spread 
the word between developers, marketers, thinkers, and other similar people who might help. There
is no way that this enormous, ambitious project can be completed by a small number of people. We 
must work together in order to complete the project.
