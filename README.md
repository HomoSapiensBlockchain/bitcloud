**Welcome to Bitcloud**

We are currently in the early stages of developing a protocol that will change the world forever.
We are calling it Bitcloud, this is done to separate it from Wetube, which is the interface. The main, important features are:

* We are generating money from bandwidth sharing as opposed to mining.
* We introduce publishers to make the content of our net of very high quality (anyone can become a publisher).
* We optionally protect the IP and identity of the users and nodes that share
  delicate content, and use encryption for everghing.
* And we use a blockchain like other decentralized projects, however it is quite different from any others.
* We don't initially own 100% of the coins like in "Mastercoin" or "Next".


**Help Work With us and Become Part of the Team**

We want to make the process of creating Bitcloud *extremely* open,
allowing anyone who wants to participate to share his or her opinion and help with the project.


**Spread the Word**

We are contacting developers and thinkers only now, as we don't want this project to become mainstream until we have something to really work in and a good bunch of developers. This being said, we are looking to expand the development side of the project. So, please, spread the word between developers, marketers, thinkers, and other similar people who might help. There is no way that this big project can be completed by 1, 2 or 5 people. We must work together.
