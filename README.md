# Bitcloud Objectives

For a technical overview, read
[overview.org](https://github.com/wetube/bitcloud/blob/master/overview.org).

In essence, we want to construct a Peer to Peer cloud with economic
incentives, a decentralized market for information, in which everybody will be
able to upload, download and publish content, and install a node.

Authors have an opportunity to offer their content without restriction or
imposition, by selecting a publisher or become one by themselves. Their
content will be immediately available for the rest of the world.

Bitcloud will be in charge of automatically distribute files along the
network, and check all money transactions.

Publishers and authors will have the opportunity to have a voice without
having to compete against big giants. Our search engine will be globally
available and content cannot be deleted by a central authority. We don't
impose any kind of censorship nor central moderation system. We also offer
optional easy integration with Tor, protecting both the origin and the end of
the content.

At the same time, we offer the opportunity of optional moderation throughout
publishers. Publishers will have the important role of manual filtering of the
content and provide great quality. Everyone can become a publisher.



# Help Work With Us

We want to make the process of creating Bitcloud *extremely* open,
allowing anyone who wants to participate to share his or her opinion and help with the project.


# Spread the Word

We are contacting developers and thinkers only now, as we don't want this project to become mainstream until we have something to really work in and a good bunch of developers. This being said, we are looking to expand the development side of the project. So, please, spread the word between developers, marketers, thinkers, and other similar people who might help. There is no way that this big project can be completed by 1, 2 or 5 people. We must work together.
