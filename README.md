# Introduction

Bitcloud is a universal protocol aiming to provide a massive distributed
database and filesystem, or "virtual
hard disk", capable of storing data encrypted and signed across all connected
nodes, protecting privacy and guaranteeing quality of service (QoS).


Bitcloud can be the base for decentralized applications that require data
storage and bandwidth. There are many Bitcoin 2.0 projects in the works right
now, but they all still rely on some type of blockchain. In Bitcloud, the
blockchain is replaced by a distributed database, also known as the
nodepool. Bitcloud creates a new decentralized system of trust where entire
web applications can be hosted without a centralized server.

Bitcloud is *coin agnostic*, meaning that it only pretends to be the base for
the storage needs of future DAs. Bitcloud can use the escrow capabilities of
Bitcoin and/or the contracts of Ethereum. Bitcloud pretends to substitute the
way in which servers interconnect today and make much easier, secure and
private for users, publishers and DAs to share files, and will be *fundamental*
for the upcoming DAs.


Whether you're watching videos from YouTube or listening to music on
Soundcloud, you're getting all of your content through one centralized
source. That centralized source could decide to delete certain content or be
forced to delete controversial content by a local government. The core
principles behind decentralized applications built on top of Bitcloud are
decentralization, complete autonomy, open source, and the choice of anonymity.

# Help Work With Us

We want to make the process of creating Bitcloud *extremely* open, allowing
anyone who wants to participate to share their opinion and help with the
project.

Look at our current team [here](http://bitcloudproject.org/w/Team).

Watch us at github.

And, most importantly, join us [here](http://bitcloudproject.org/w/Join_Us).

Thanks!
