We are in the early stages of developing a protocol that will change the world forever.
We are calling it Bitcloud, to separate it from Wetube, which is the interface. The main important features are:

* We are generating money from bandwidth sharing instead of mining!
* We introduce publishers to make the content of our net of very high quality (anyone can become a publisher).
* We optionally protect the IP and identity of the users and nodes that share
  delicate content, and use encryption for everghing.
* And we have a blockchain, too! But quite different from actual ones.
* We don't initially own 100% of the coins like in Mastercoin or Next


**YOU HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO WORK WITH US IN THIS VERY EARLY PROCESS AND BECOME PART OF THE  TEAM DOING THE MAIN DECISIONS.**

We want, as an experiment, to make this process REALLY open,
allowing anyone who wants to participate to share his or her opinion.

**SPREAD THE WORD**
We are contacting developers and thinkers only now, as we don't want this project to become mainstream until we have something to really work in and a good bunch of developers.
Please, spread the word between developers, marketers, thinkers, and similar people. There is no way that 1, 2 or 5 people can do this big project alone. We must go together.
